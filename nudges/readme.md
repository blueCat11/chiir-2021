Nudges in the naturalistic study were composed of several elements using data generated by that participants behavior.
First was the measure of privacy (five different kinds used in the study). 
Then participant's values in this measure were presented in comparison to all other participants, graphically and then ranked using percentages, first for the duration of the whole study up to that point, then for the last completed day of the study prior to the current date.
The direction of the colored bars is always from low value of the measure on the left to high value of the measure on the right. Emojis and Color (red = privacy invasive, green = privacy protective) are used to denote whether a low value is good or bad for privacy.

Damit ist Ihr Browsingverhalten privater als das von [percentage]% der Teilnehmer

[description of measure of privacy]

During the whole study duration: from [start date] to [date prior to current date]
![Colored bar from red to green with a sad smiley at the red end and happy smiley at the green end. Participant's value depicted as "You", Average depicted as "Average" on that bar.](https://github.com/blueCat11/chiir-2020/blob/main/nudges/Nudge_colors_English.PNG)

That means your browsing behavior is more private than that of [percentage]% of other participants

During the last full day: [date prior to current date]
![Colored bar from red to green with a sad smiley at the red end and happy smiley at the green end. Participant's value depicted as "You", Average depicted as "Average" on that bar.](https://github.com/blueCat11/chiir-2020/blob/main/nudges/Nudge_colors_English.PNG)

That means your browsing behavior is more private than that of [percentage]% of other participants
