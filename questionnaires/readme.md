**Boost evaluation**

The qualtrics generated pdf-file with the procedure and the questions is in the *questionnaires/boost_evaluation* folder. 
The survey was conducted among German language speakers, and thus is in German.

We can help you translate and then provide the translated version on this repository for others.

**Naturalistic study**

Before the study, participants were administered five questionnaires in the following order:
1. ATI (Affinity for Technology Interaction), available both in English and German from this website: https://ati-scale.org/
2. OPLIS (Online Privacy Litercy Scale), available in ![German](http://www.oplis.de/download_ger.html) and ![English](http://www.oplis.de/download.html), although the scale was developed with the German privacy law in mind, and thus may not be readily applicable in other countries.
3. A questionnaire on self-reported privacy behavior, as used by Zimmerman et al (2019), and translated to German by the first author. 
The English questions can be found here: https://github.com/stevenzim/sigir-2019 (questions AQ3-7 and HQ2-3) 
and the German questions are at *questionnaires/naturalistic/privacy_behavior.pdf*. 
Compared to Zimmerman et al's version, Ecosia was added as another browser option, since multiple participants had asked about that browser during recruitment.
4. IUIPC (Internet Usersâ€™ Information Privacy Concerns), as described by Malhotra et al (2004) (English version in ![that paper](https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.1040.0032)'s annex).
The constructs Trusting Beliefs, Risk Beliefs, Collection, Awareness and Control were all measured. 
A German version of these items was obtained through private communication with David Harborth, as ![Harborth and Pape (2019)](https://aisel.aisnet.org/hicss-52/in/behavioral_is_security/5/) stated the use of such a translation.
5. Boost knowledge was evaluated using the control group subset of questions from the boost evaluation study, with one image changed after evaluating the boosts. 
The new image is at *questionnaires/naturalistic/boost_comprehension.pdf*. 
Any demographics from the boost evaluation questionnaire as it was used in the first study, were omitted here.

After the study, participants were administered two questionnaires in the given order:
1. Boost knowledge questionnaire, the same questionnaire as used pre-study.
2. Demographic questionnaire, questions in German available at *questionnaires/naturalistic/demographics.pdf*.
